	<h2>Task Introduction:</h2>
	<p>\t1 Billion Drops is a company that is committed to facilitating the transfer of information in the humanitarian aid world needed to further help the communities they’re working with. They do so with an app where a humanitarian aid worker or a person in need can post the type of aid needed at a certain location. This is then viewable by anyone using the app or website.</p>
	<h2>Task:</h2>

  	<pre>//We recommend using dummy data and a dummy WordPress site to test your script.</pre> 
	<h2>Extra Info:</h2>
	<p>\tWork quickly because many other people are working at the same time as you! We expect this to take roughly 3 to 4 hours, but it will be open as long as it takes our coders to complete. We will send updates periodically.</p>
