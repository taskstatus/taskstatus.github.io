## Task Introduction:
  * 1 Billion Drops is a company that is committed to facilitating the transfer of information in the humanitarian aid world needed to further help the communities they’re working with. They do so with an app where a humanitarian aid worker or a person in need can post the type of aid needed at a certain location. This is then viewable by anyone using the app or website.
 
## Task:
  * Right now, the app’s data is not transferred to the website automatically. Automate data delivery from the app’s database to the website.

## Pet Code:
```javascript
  //[none] This will be implemented as a standalone NODE.js JavaScript Script.
  //We recommend using dummy data and a dummy WordPress site to test your script.
``` 

## Extra Info:
  * Work quickly because many other people are working at the same time as you! We expect this to take roughly 3 to 4 hours, but it will be open as long as it takes our coders to complete. We will send updates periodically.
